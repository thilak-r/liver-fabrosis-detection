# üåü Liver Fibrosis Detection using Deep Learning

## ü©∫ **Why is Liver Fibrosis Detection Important?**
Liver fibrosis is a serious medical condition caused by the excessive buildup of connective tissue in the liver due to chronic damage. Left untreated, it can progress to cirrhosis and even liver failure, significantly impacting patients' lives. Early and accurate detection of liver fibrosis is critical for timely intervention and effective treatment, reducing the burden on patients and healthcare systems.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
This project is an advanced AI-based system to detect and classify liver fibrosis stages (F0 to F4) from medical images. Using a pretrained **ResNet-18** model and optimized training methods, our model achieves high accuracy and reliability in distinguishing between subtle stages of fibrosis.

---

##  **Key Features**
- **Non-Invasive Analysis**: Provides predictions directly from liver images, reducing reliance on biopsies.
- **ResNet-18 Backbone**: Fine-tuned for classifying five fibrosis stages with high precision.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated **confusion matrix** and **training vs. validation accuracy plots**.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced feature extraction to address class imbalances and improve performance.

## üìä **Dataset Summary**
- **Total Images**: 6,323
- **Classes**:
  - `F0`: Normal liver tissue (2,114 images)
  - `F1`: Portal fibrosis without septum (861 images)
  - `F2`: Portal fibrosis with fewer septa (793 images)
  - `F3`: Many septa but no cirrhosis (857 images)
  - `F4`: Liver cirrhosis (1,698 images)
    
- **Data Split**:
  - **Training Set**: 70%
  - **Validation Set**: 15%
  - **Test Set**: 15%

### üîë **Results**

Our model demonstrated exceptional accuracy and robust performance across all fibrosis stages, from F0 (healthy tissue) to F4 (severe cirrhosis). By effectively handling the challenges of differentiating between early fibrosis stages such as F1, F2, and F3‚Äîwhich often exhibit subtle and overlapping characteristics‚Äîthe model proves its reliability for clinical-grade liver fibrosis detection.

Leveraging the power of the pretrained ResNet-18 architecture, combined with advanced data augmentation techniques and extensive training, the model excels in identifying key patterns within medical imaging data. The integration of a balanced dataset and careful preprocessing ensures its robustness and adaptability across various scenarios. Moreover, the use of metrics like the confusion matrix and ROC curves validates its high precision and recall across all classes, ensuring minimal misclassifications.

This achievement highlights the model's potential for real-world applications, such as:

Non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis, reducing the need for painful and invasive biopsies.
Early-stage detection that empowers healthcare professionals to intervene promptly, potentially halting or reversing disease progression.
Monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy in patients with chronic liver conditions.
